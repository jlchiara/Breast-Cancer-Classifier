# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
The **Breast Cancer Classifier** is a logistic regression model designed to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. This tool is crucial for improving healthcare outcomes by reducing the rate of false negatives, where missing a malignant tumor can have severe consequences compared to false positives.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a critical health issue, and early and accurate diagnosis is vital. This project uses logistic regression to classify breast tumors based on features extracted from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The primary goal is to enhance the detection of malignant tumors and reduce the risk associated with false negatives.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Wisconsin dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?select=data.csv). The dataset includes various features of breast tumors, such as texture, smoothness, and concavity, which are used to train and test the classification model.
